# project General Comments.

- In a case of a big project we can declar the webelements variables outside of the methods, to allow the re-userbility and avoid duplication use of variables.
- The Reason why i choose to use Json in this project it's becasue of it's compact, much easy to learn, easy to read data and easy to understand.

# Dev standard
